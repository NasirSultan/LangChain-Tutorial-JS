## Smart Product Assistant for Price and Inventory Queries

**Description:**
This is a command-line assistant that helps users ask questions about products, such as:

* Listing all available products
* Getting the latest price of a specific product
* Pulling recent data from product change logs (like updates or deletions)

It understands natural language queries, detects the user's intent (such as "list products" or "get price of iPhone"), and generates clear, helpful responses.

Ideal for support teams, inventory managers, or internal tools that need quick product insights from a database.
