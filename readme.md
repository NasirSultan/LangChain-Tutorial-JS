#  Prompt Formatting â€“ LangChain Example

## Overview

This project shows how to create a simple prompt template using LangChain. It helps generate a natural-language prompt to ask an AI model for a company name based on two products.

## What It Does

* Creates a reusable prompt format.
* Replaces product placeholders with actual product names like "socks" and "shoes".
* Outputs the final prompt string.

## Purpose

The goal is to demonstrate how prompt templates work in LangChain, making it easier to build AI prompts from dynamic inputs.

## Requirements

* Node.js installed
* LangChain core package installed

## How to Run

Use a Node.js environment to run the script. It prints the formatted prompt that can be used with an AI model.

## Notes

This example does not call any AI model directly. It only shows how to prepare a prompt that can be sent to one.
