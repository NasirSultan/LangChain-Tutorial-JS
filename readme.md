#Add a Prompt in LLM using LangChain and Gemini

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a prompt with a large language model (LLM) by integrating LangChain with Googleâ€™s Gemini Flash API.

## Purpose

It shows how to create a prompt, fill it with dynamic values, and send it to an LLM for generating creative responses such as company names, ideas, or any kind of text output.

## Key Concepts

* **PromptTemplate**: Helps you define a reusable text template with placeholders.
* **LLM Invocation**: The formatted prompt is passed to the Gemini Flash model to generate results.
* **Dynamic Input**: You can supply any values for placeholders like product names.

## Workflow

1. A prompt template is defined with variables.
2. Real data is inserted into the prompt.
3. The final prompt is sent to the Gemini LLM.
4. The model responds with a relevant, generated result.

## Benefits

* Easy to scale and reuse prompts.
* Clean integration with generative models.
* Supports multiple LLMs through LangChain.

## Ideal For

* AI-powered applications
* Chatbots or virtual assistants
* Creative writing tools
* Business name generators
