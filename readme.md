# LangChain JS Tutorial: with Gemini

I'm happy to share a beginner-friendly tutorial that walks through the **core concepts of LangChain JS** using **Google Gemini** as the LLM. This tutorial is divided into **5 focused parts**, each available in a separate GitHub branch to help you learn step-by-step.

##  Tutorial Structure

Each part of the tutorial is isolated in its **own branch**:

1. **`prompt`** – Creating dynamic prompt templates with variables  
2. **`llm`** – Understanding and invoking LLMs using LangChain  
3. **`llm-model`** – Using Gemini Flash 1.5 with LangChain JS  
4. **`memory`** – Adding memory to retain conversation history  
5. **`read-pdf`** – Reading PDFs and answering questions from the content

You can switch between these branches using:

```bash
git checkout prompt
git checkout llm
# etc.
