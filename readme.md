# Conversational LangChain Agent with Tool Support

This project demonstrates a powerful built-in agent in LangChain called `chat-conversational-react-description`. It supports full memory for multi-turn conversations and dynamic tool usage â€” making it ideal for building intelligent AI chatbots.

## Features

* Conversational memory using `BufferMemory`
* Natural language understanding with Mistral chat model
* Support for external tools like a calculator
* Ability to handle follow-up and context-based queries
* Easily extendable with custom tools or APIs

## Project Structure

* `index.js`: Main entry file that sets up the agent
* `.env`: Stores your Mistral API key
* `package.json`: Manages project dependencies

## How It Works

**Agent Type**
This agent uses the `chat-conversational-react-description` type. It can carry on a conversation, use tools when needed, and remember previous inputs in the conversation flow.

**Memory**
`BufferMemory` is used to store the chat history. This enables context-aware responses. For example, after asking "What is 30 + 70?", you can follow up with "Multiply that by 2" and the agent will understand the context.

**Tools**
A custom tool is added to evaluate mathematical expressions. You can add more tools for APIs, databases, file processing, and other tasks. The agent automatically decides when to call a tool based on the user's query.

## Tech Stack

* Node.js
* LangChain
* Mistral AI (via @langchain/mistralai)
* MathJS
* dotenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file and add your Mistral API key

## Usage

Run the project with Node. The agent will respond to inputs with memory support and use the calculator tool when appropriate.

## Customization

You can extend this agent by adding additional tools, such as:

* Weather API integration
* Web scraping
* File parsing
* Knowledge base search

Each tool can be built using LangChain's `DynamicTool` and added to the tool list during initialization.
